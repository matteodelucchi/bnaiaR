#' Aneurysm Data Base Raw
#'
#' Aneurysm data from Geneva (AneuQuest + AneuX) harmonized to ISGC variables.
#' Harmonization was performed according the harmonization matrix from Morel et al. 2021
#' and is implemented in \link[bnaiaR]{crim4toISGC} and  \link[bnaiaR]{crim5toISGC} respectively.
#' Contains missing values.
